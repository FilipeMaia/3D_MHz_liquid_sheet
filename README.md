# 3D MHz liquid sheet
Data analysis scripts, molecular dynamic files and nozzle CAD files for the manuscript [3D-Printed Sheet Jet for Stable Megahertz Liquid Sample Delivery at X-ray Free Electron Lasers](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.07626).

The analysis was performed using [JupyterHub at DESY's Maxwell cluster](https://confluence.desy.de/display/MXW/JupyterHub+on+Maxwell) with the `xfel (current)` kernel located at `/gpfs/exfel/sw/software/mambaforge/22.11/envs/202301`.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with GROMACS 2021.4.

The data is available at [CXIDB ID 218](https://www.cxidb.org/id/218.html).
